## Abstract

This is an entirely new gamemode for CM-SS13, directly inspired from Valve's Team Fortress 2 Gamemode of similar naming, where it follows almost the exact same gameplay from there.
We have seen WO, an absolute defense gamemode where one side is forced to bash their head against cades until they win, but what about a marine version of WO? What about a game mode that forces attack above all else?
In this game mode, marines will have to push an experimental xenocidal bomb in an infested mine to the mining pit, where the heart of the hive resides below.

<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

## Goals

1. Make a new game mode that is focused soley on the push to victory
    Cadehugging should absolutely be shafted to hell and back in this gamemode as pushing is the way to advance. Mechanics should reflect this.

2. Maps should be linear, but allow flanking on linear push points.
    The main push shall be the largest and intentional chokepoints should always have flanks.

3. Marines should not be able to kill all of the Xenos.
    The way the game mode should be designed is that numbers still matter to the xenos, so they don't suicide charge, but they are given just enough handouts to barely defend against the marines. Hive should be a safe space for xenos, either through one way doors or being in admin Z level with a tunnel connecting it

4. Reduce attrtion and stalemates seen in normal gameplay.
    Stalemates are awful and this gamemode is meant to keep everything moving. The checkpoint system with achievable goals that reward both sides to keep the round in motion shall achieve this
<!-- This is a numbered list clearly detailing your goals for the feature. As per usual, this should be a mixture of both why and what. -->

## Non-goals

1.  Have PMCs/survivors be too dominant in the gamemode
    Survivors in the gamemode are meant to be to keep xenos busy early game while forcing PMCs to split up to rescue them and enable power.


<!-- Just like goals, but the opposite! Every feature has boundaries it won't step over. These should be written as if they start with "We will not...". -->

## Content

### Maps
The gamemode will feature its own maps, being linear by design with few ways to deviate main push besides intentional chokepoints having their own dedicated flanking routes. Random possible invisible checkpoints will be placed along the rail track to trigger events if the payload passes them.

Having them randomly selected out of a possible pool discourages metagaming them.

Each map however has to have a prebuilt FOB with sufficient prebuilt defenses, with an added ERT shuttle LZ and the bomb location (mining pit) with several pre spawned acid pillars.

### Round start/Early game

PO roll will be removed. No CAS will exist as everything is deep underground. No mortar spawns either. Either OBs or a limited use rail gun is avalible.

PO role will be replaced with W-Y contracted vegetation specialists who come with chainsaws. These chainsaws saw through xeno walls after a short interaction, however they must be completely covered in doing so

APC is meant to act as a mobile FOB to keep the marines going, and the map should be designed to where it can only move along the main tunnel and cannot push the payload.

Survivor roles renamed will be active and given better equipment. 

PMC roles will be avalible and spawn in a prebuilt FOB. Their primary objective before the marines arrive is to search for and rescue survivors and to activate power. Activating power is highly beneficial as the floodlights in the mine will be turned on, distracting xenos from building.

Marines will spawn in the almayer as normal to drop at 12:25.

Xenos on the otherhand will have an immovable, pre placed hive away from the objective with a larva amount that is not infinate, but gradually. This makes so xenos will not have to focus on captures, while still having some risk remaining so suicide charging is discouraged. In addition, all larva start with full evo so they may evolve instantly.

Deep in the caves beyond survivor spawns will indestructable doors that will prevent hive diving PMCs and survivors. These doors will turn destructable when the mid game starts.

The role of queen in the gamemode still being contemplated as she will be forcefully glued to the ovi. 

If PMCs recover 75% of the survivors, they get a greentext. These survivors may join the fight in the mid game as PFC+ along with remaining PMCs

### Mid-late game

The mid game starts when the marines arrive and the Xenocidal Bomb is placed on a mining cart to be pushed to its objective. Once the payload moves out of FOB, the xeno evolution rate is doubled.

 As the marines move the payload, they will activate the invisible checkpoints, triggering certain events.
 These events are:
    - All checkpoints for marines: Will get a choice between a pre-equipped ERT spawning at the ERT dock or 5+ railgun shells
    - First checkpoint: Xenos get a T1 ERT that spawns behind marine lines + a couple larva bonus.
    - Second checkpoint: Xenos get an XRT with 1 garunteed boiler spawn + larva bonus
    - Third checkpoint: Xenos get an XRT with a scalable about of T3s spawning depending on pop + large larva bonus
### Endgame

Upon fighting fiercly to the pit, marines will have to push the actual bomb into the pit. This is a X minute interation that is interruptable as xenos fight for their lives in an epic battle for the fate of the hive.


### Win conditions

Xenos can win by
    - Time, as marines have to get the payload within X hour and X minutes
    - Killing all marines groundside. Hijack is disabled and they will win immediately upon taking groundside.

Marines can win by:
    - Pushing the payload to the pit and destroying the hive with the xenocidal bomb. Ooorah!


<!-- Now's where you get into clear detail about everything your feature does. **You should still be explaining 'why' things are that way, *as* you describe what.** Be as detailed as possible. -->

## Alternatives

<!-- Provide potential alternatives to your feature, either ones that align with your design values, or ones that don't that you suspect will be suggested. If you are including the latter, make sure to explain why you didn't choose that. -->

## Potential Changes

Too biased toward one side
    Adjust the checkpoint rewards to compensate. Alternatively can take more drastic measures such as adding consistant respawns for a side, restricting xeno wall building till X time. adjusting amounts of AP ammo or spawning marines pre equipped on FOB akin to WO to limit their loadout choices.




<!-- Most of the time you're not going to get the best design first try. It helps to try your best to predict what *could* go wrong, and suggest alternatives that can be taken, without sacrificing your design. -->
