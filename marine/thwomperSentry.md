## Abstract
*Terminology*
*twebs          = Techwebs*



With techwebs dead and it's remenants being the techwebs sentries we have today, we have been confronted with a plethora of balance issues as they are not meant for post-techwebs CM. Bell sentry and its upgrades are continually getting nerfed, even today. Flamer,tesla mini sentries have been nerfed into becoming a meme. DMR sentry is king with its ridiculous range and has been given an equally ridiculous no sentry area to prevent stacking (you still can do it btw). Flags are in a confusing spot for a defensive role and are just asking to be reworked.

Sentries in general are ,though helpful to the marines, are unimportant and are not too difficult to kill by xenos. 

With all that said, it is pretty clear that they have become difficult to balance and a rework is needed. This is where a modified version of thwompers rework comes into play. Existing tweb (techwebs) sentries will be removed, with a select few "keepers" being reworked and we will bring back better, but more limited and defensive oriented sentries that are based on the old "comrade" sentries. These, along with few reworked twebs buildings will be relatively important defensive and offensive tools.


<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

## Goals
1. Complexity is our enemy
    - We don't want to create a complicated system that only a few people truly know how to use. Systems should be plug and play and should work together without any fidiling.
2. Twebs buildings/sentries shall not only be important for the marines, but bring importance to the roles they are given to aswell
    - As we are giving them to multiple roles, it is adamant that they highlight the importance of those roles such as SL/Comtech/IO to revert the bad trend of them slowly becoming PFC+ roles.
    - For SL

<!-- This is a numbered list clearly detailing your goals for the feature. As per usual, this should be a mixture of both why and what. -->

## Non-goals
1.  Be unbalanced
    - We don't want it to be inbalanced
2. Feature bloat
    - This rework only mainly covers reworked twebs buildings/devices for IO/Engi/SL aswell as a reworked sentry system and will NOT create any new buildings or go more past that.
    - We don't want to spend 2 billion years in dev hell as people say "oh what if we had X" Please no.

<!-- Just like goals, but the opposite! Every feature has boundaries it won't step over. These should be written as if they start with "We will not...". -->

## Content
Like the past, UA-571 sentries will in buildable kits. They will be modifiable, with a tradeoff between firing angle, range and rate of fire (capped) See picture for an illustration of the trade offs and caps. Normal firerate cap is only a couple tiles below the normal range if at all.

Sentries will be much more rarer, either having one per squad prep like the old days or given to req with a minimum of four a round and a maximum of six. May or may not be purchaseable in limited quantities. This will make sentries much more important resources that will be used sparingly.

Ammo for the sentries will go much quicker and ASRS will be adjusted to give ammo accordingly

### Base station
    Each sentry will be able to be connected to a base station. This extends their capability well beyond a static defense to a unified defense infrastructure that is controllable and accessible at a single centralized point as seen in the Aliens director's cut "robot sentry" scene.

    This base station will show the ammo, currently engaged targets and allow for the operator to view the sentry's camera as well as any motion detectors connected to it. The base station can be tweaked to alert a specific radio channel if an ammo threshold or target threashold is reached by any of the connected sentries/motion towers. It also requires to be connected to a generator.

    Upon destruction of the base station, the connected sentries will be disabled for an entire minute unless manually "reset" by an engineer.

    The base station is indented to add depth and *soul* to sentries as well as adding a unified infrastructure to add depth to FOBs.

### New devices
    - XM-820 CBRN Air scrubber
        This is a device that can counter boiler gas within a range around it with the downsides of being fragile, not portable and potentially requiring a portable generator with fuel. None will be given roundstart but req can purchase one.
    - GT-204 "Thumper" Seismic Wave generator
        *Originally the Seegson GS-204 ,it's overclocking beyond manufacterer specifications by Argus Mining Corporation led to it's contribution to the 'LV-403 Argus Mining incident' where thousands of poor miners were entombed to their deaths deep within the tunnel systems. Ironically, this incident intrigued the USCM, who have used it to detect and even remotely damage CLF tunnel systems with the seismic waves it generates. It can also greatly disrupt potentially hostile local fauna, which makes it useful even without a CLF presence.*

        If you are thinking the thumpers found in HL2, you are correct. This outright prevents weeding in an area and is 1x2. Takes one minute to start up. Purchasable by req.
    - Portable Fission generator
        A generator that spawns in req and is also purchasable. Requires fission fuel rods that are slowly depleted throughout the round. Required for the scrubber and base station.


### Techwebs devices
    - All devices and their upgrades will be gutted unless otherwise stated below.


    - Upgrade kits
        This will be spread out into individual purchasable upgrades for sentries at differing costs
            Upgrades:
                - Holotargetting ammo system
                    Shoots holotargetting ammo instead at the cost of damage and firerate
                - Sentry Gyrojet conversion kit
                    Gives extra and AP but firerate cap is cut in half and uses its own ammo. Trades Firerate and firing angle for range and damage. See chart
                
    - JIMA stationary flag
        Will be in req at an extremely limited amount, (1-3 per round)
    - JIMA Flag backpack
        The JIMA flag backpack be reworked into standard equipment for SLs that work like a satchel and have satchel storage space. 
        This is intended to not only give importance to SLs, but to encourage marines sticking onto their SLs for the buffs aswell as discouraging deathballs as the buffs will *NOT* stack.
    - Bell tower
        Will be reworked into a Motion Detector Tower using the motion detector tower sprites. See above. Detects targets within a range and reports them to the base station. These also can "highlight" one or two targets at a time. highlighted targets recieve extra damage from connected sentries. This is intended to make it much more of a threat to solo xenos attacking FOB as well as making base stations and motion detector towers more important.
    - Minisentry
        Will remain purchaseable by comtechs. Will likely be rebalanced. This will fill the "offensive" sentry gap as they are not impeding on a frontline without being odd to balance or too powerful. Purchaseable by IOs and comtechs
    - Bell backpack
        Will be reworked into the XS-201B Sonic Boom pack. Upon triggering, will emit a sonic boom that slows everyone within a range down, including yourself. This is an intresting device that is useful in situations where your opponents need speed more than you do. Purchasable by IOs. Multiple minute cooldown.
            This is intended to give IOs an skillful counter to runners/lurkers that is both counterable and fun to play with and against.
        

    



<!-- Now's where you get into clear detail about everything your feature does. **You should still be explaining 'why' things are that way, *as* you describe what.** Be as detailed as possible. -->

## Alternatives

<!-- Provide potential alternatives to your feature, either ones that align with your design values, or ones that don't that you suspect will be suggested. If you are including the latter, make sure to explain why you didn't choose that. -->

## Potential Changes

<!-- Most of the time you're not going to get the best design first try. It helps to try your best to predict what *could* go wrong, and suggest alternatives that can be taken, without sacrificing your design. -->
