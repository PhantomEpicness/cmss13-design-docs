## Abstract
<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->
Globber boiler is a challenging strain that replaces riskless bombard with a challenging and yet fun "glob" projectiles reminiscent from premoba boilers that spray acid.
It's true purpose is to replace Trapper with much more challenging gameplay, while having more or less the same sieging power that is actually sort of counterable by marines.
## Goals

<!-- This is a numbered list clearly detailing your goals for the feature. As per usual, this should be a mixture of both why and what. -->
1. Globber should be challenging, yet rewarding. Challenge + rewarding = fun
   Challenge + rewarding = fun. Trapper and base have rewarding without the challenge.
2. Globber is defense focused with a heavy emphasis on sieging.
3. Should retain more or less the same sieging ability than trapper
  It's going to replace it. (:
4. Globber can serve as an alternative to boiler.
  Due to the nature of the strain, it can serve as an alternative to the boiler and adapt to its role if required


## Non-goals

<!-- Just like goals, but the opposite! Every feature has boundaries it won't step over. These should be written as if they start with "We will not...". -->
1. Majorily upset balance. We do not want globber to be frustrating to fight or to be uncounterable.

2. Make xeno defense/ sieging overpowered. We do not want xeno defenses or sieging to be buffed to a great degree from this. It should more or less replace trapper.

3. Replace defualt boiler. We will not have this replace default boiler as it still has its place. Clear limitations shall be implemented to prevent this.


## Content

<!-- Now's where you get into clear detail about everything your feature does. **You should still be explaining 'why' things are that way, *as* you describe what.** Be as detailed as possible. -->

Globber will be given upgraded health and slightly increased speed as its ability to shoot at range is limited compared to base as there will be no zoom and will be exposed when winding up. 

Ability 1: Fire glob
Fires the selected glob

Ability 2: Switch globs

Switch between three types of globs, Acid and Slime

Ability 3: Acid dump

Sprays acid in a spray cone with limited range. Causes c/d to trigger on the other abilities. Meant to be as a close range fighting ability.
Sprays instantly, but acid travels slow. Can be combo'd with slime glob.

Ability 4: TBA

Acid glob:

This glob serves as globbers's primary sieging ability. It also is a decently large AoE attack and can serve as a substitute for normal boiler gas if the situation requires it.
However it is much worse than normal boiler gas when used in this situation, since vision is not blocked by gas, enabling marines to see.
It takes an amount of time to detonate, so marines can notice it and begin to run away before the acid sprays out. Acid spraying out takes a bit of time to spread.

Slime Glob:

Instead of damaging marines with acid damage it slows down any marines caught in it or that steps in it. 
The radius is smaller, but it lasts longer and detonates quicker.

Intended as a defensive ability and an echo of trapper's traps.


## Alternatives
Good alternatives:

Bringing back projectile boiler - This can still be added as an alternative flavor to boiler.

Replacing normal boiler -  Upon further thought, this caste could actually be a fun version of Base boiler with with several changes made. The acid spray nades would be replaced with gas/neuro nades instead. In that case, it is a possibility that this trapper replacement could still be implemented as a strain.

Bad alternatives:

"Just Keep Trapper" - This is a replacement to trapper, a caste with pretty much no risk gameplay. Would result in massively conflicting purpose which would likley end up
having one strain never be used.

"Just Remove trapper" - It leaves a hole in the xeno lineup, xenos need their sieging ability. Boiler needs new flavors. Boilers need challenge

<!-- Provide potential alternatives to your feature, either ones that align with your design values, or ones that don't that you suspect will be suggested. If you are including the latter, make sure to explain why you didn't choose that. -->

## Potential Changes
Thing that could go wrong - Globber is too robust and dominates defensively

How to fix - Nerfs to acid glob. Alternatively can increase marine damage or buff CAS

Thing that could go wrong - Globber is too robust and dominates sieging

How to fix - Nerfs to acid glob's cade damage.

Thing that could go wrong - Globber is too squishy

How to fix - Possible buffs to globber health/armor

<!-- Most of the time you're not going to get the best design first try. It helps to try your best to predict what *could* go wrong, and suggest alternatives that can be taken, without sacrificing your design. -->
