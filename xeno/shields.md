## Abstract

<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

A wider variety of "buff abilities" is used instead of shields. These are applied to limited castes, mainly drone evos and prae.

Buff abilities are explained further below. Shields are kept for castes that only give them to themselves.

Shields are integrated, in some cases, into these buff abilities.

## Goals

1. To replace shields with buff abilities

2. To make said buff abilities intuitive and well telegraphed

3. To make said buff abilities increase survivability and durability but not persist off the front line / long after they are applied.

4. To use a variety of buff abilities that are not underpowered or essential for engagements (xenos should not rely on them)

5. To not add buff abilities to new castes that did not have them previously.

## Non-goals

1. Majorly affect side balance. This design does not aim to make a side stronger or weaker with this, which is why every caste gets compensatory buffs.

2. Make warrior too squishy on the front-line and unable to stay there for any longer amount of time due to a lack of buff ability or shield

3. Majorly handhold xenos with these buffs or make them required for engagements (think xenos afking in the hive for maturity - we don't want xenos to have to afk for buffs before going into a fight)

4. Repeat the same buff abilities over and over on different xenos. When a xeno needs a shield-like buff ability, it should be unique to some extent. 

5. Make said buff abilities overpowered and frustrating to fight.

## Content

Shields to be replaced in most areas by buff abilities.

Buff abilities to be temporary, somewhat increase durability or survivability, or give a resistance to a xeno. They are not to be heals. 

Varied types of buff ability to be made (clarity, speed boosts, etc) and given to different castes where they best fit.

Buff abilities to be limited to praetorians, carriers (shaman), the queen, drone (gardener), and potentially other castes that already have buff abilities. Shaman carrier and Warden prae **must** recieve new buff abilities or offensive abilities to compensate for their loss of shields.

Buff abilities that can be used at a range, are expected to be weaker than melee range ones. Ones with a channel can be stronger. Ones that can be used through overwatch should be made weaker when used in this state or limited to the queen.

Castes that have buff abilities that only buff themselves are not to recieve buff abilities that can buff other xenos.

Shields, or buffs like them, exist to give xenos more durability and strength - basically to increase their survivability not in the form of a simple heal. It should be clear to players when this xeno is more durable, and should also not persist off the frontline or majorly interfere with how you fight a specific caste when they are applied. 

A "buff ability" is a replacement for shields, and is the name that is used to refer to any ability that can replace shields.

Clarity stacks are limited effect stacks that let xenos resist minor stuns, can be seen on boxer warrior. These can be used as replacement buffs for shields

Warden is a xeno that can provide, as one of its abilities, short-term buffs or heals. Heals from it need to be partly "over-time" and not entirely up-front health dumped into the xeno. (not long term spam shields)

Shaman is a xeno that can provide, as one of its abilities, short-term AOE buffs or AOE heals. (not long term shields for the entire hive such as in hijack)

Warrior is a xeno that is hard to kill in a 1v1 and takes a frontliner / ambusher role with a preferably higher focus on frontlining. It is not a xeno that can easily stay far away from the main frontline without nearby weeds or assistance like lurker, it is not a xeno that can very easily disengage and run away like lurker. 

## Specific changes (preliminary ideas)

Shields to be removed from all but crusher, rav. Remaining shields in any area MUST have audio or visual cues.

Warden shield - replace with a speed boost / warrior clarity stacks / fire extinguish? -> a buff that helps xenos at the front line, and can help them while they are at full health

Carrier shield - replace with aoe clarity stacks / a 10s aoe clarity effect / slash damage -> some other kind of buff that makes xenos better offensively

Vanguard can prob keep shield since it’s just a one free hit mechanic, but it should also have a slight visual cue, such as a special overlay or something.

Base Prae shield from spit also needs to be removed, it’s not super significant so maybe just a tiny health buff, but can prob be just fine with no change

Shield fruit to be replaced with another type of short-term buff fruit (such as speed, damage, clarity, plasma, heal over time)


## Alternatives

Good alternatives:

1. Cut down on some of the xeno buffs and replace them with marine nerfs

2. Make the castes with buff abilities get some offensive abilities instead

Bad alternatives:

1. "Just change shields to extra health" - doesn't give them a telegraph, is equally inconsistent and has the same problems as shields

2. "Just fix the problems with shields" - boring, would result in the game being even more arcade-y (shields are already EXTREMELY arcade-y), the goal of rectifying the reasons for this shift to buff abilities can't really be accomplished without it.

3. "Just give shields glows and nerf them slightly" - see above

## Potential Changes

Thing that could go wrong - xenos become underpowered due to not having frontline durability/specific castes become underpowered

How to fix - marine nerfs to things like AP ammo.

Thing that could go wrong - the buff abilities are too powerful and make xenos even more robust than before

How to fix - tune down their power.

Thing that could go wrong - buff abilities become eclipsed by other strains and castes

How to fix - specific buffs to buff abilities.

## Misc reasons why shields in their state as of March 2022 are bad (for posterity, no strong need to read)

Shields are unintuitive and frustrating. Shields have no visual cues or indicators to marines, making it hard and frustrating to predict/anticipate. Runners can tank PBs etc and it makes xeno damage sprites not do the job they should. New players can have fights with xenos that are almost 50% stronger than as they expect, making it disheartening for them to learn that this xeno had more health with no visual cue at all. While the audio cue mitigates this in part, there’s nothing in-game that clues people into what the audio cue actually represents, and going any further to make shields more visible would impact the game’s overall aesthetic & visual clarity.

They’re often a balance nightmare. Shields mess with the AP economy majorly. They make the optimal ammo for a xeno constantly change depending on what health type they have (shield or health) and as a result they'll always impact how much total damage you can do against a xeno due to this. In addition to this, shields play a large role in power-creep, as you have to account for the large amount of shields Xenos can acquire at any one time on top of their existing health and armour pools, as well as the inconsistent “types” of shielding, i.e. Crusher shield having the property of reducing incoming damage, while something like Warden shield does not.

They are too much of a buff. Shields are long term health buffs that don't expire over time, only with use. See - shamans giving the entire hive big shields on hijack, wardens being able to do the funny with shields i.e. constantly shielding through overwatch or stacking them over and over on a frontliner, etc.

Shields handhold xenos - they provide an extra health buffer that many xenos can end up relying on for engagements, buffing the side's overall strength but limiting their individual strength (think like hugger combat). Removing shields would allow us to buff xenos to consistently have the right strength for engagements instead of this varying wildly between them. Shields also contribute to a “pocketing” meta wherein one or several Xenos that can grant shields will constantly be supplying a single player with a near-unending supply of what is effectively better health, drastically tipping the scales in a way the game isn’t really built to account for.

Other buffs are more interesting. While shields may be strong, they are boring - all they do is just add extra health and let the xenos stick around on the front for longer. Other mechanics, such as speed boosts, clarity stacks (or even tgmc style increased evasion chance) would be more engaging, unique, and some would allow for more skillful use with them (i.e. a shield boost or a proc’ed next slash with a time expiry, like sentinel.) At the end of the day shields are lazy design that would be more interesting if replaced with a wider range of abilities.
